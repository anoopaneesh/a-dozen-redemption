      <p>Nothing lit a fire in that dark place,Death was there in its poisonous waves,</p>
      <p>The <span id="clue">nine</span> shadows on the waters it cast,Plunging Lerna back into the past,</p>
      <p>Immortal was the beast of prey, For they say, Hercules felt his heart sway,</p>
      <p>And on that day, even death couldn't forsee.Which evil would decay, which monster would walk free</p>
      <p>It was Iolaus, who aided the son of Zeus, Without him, the battle would've been obtuse </p>
      <p>For loss of a head, two did replace,Burn it to ashes, the nephew did in haste</p>
      <p>Hid the <span id="clue">ninth</span> on the path form Lerna to Elaeus,Thus came an end to the feud, with a half-human victorious.</p>
